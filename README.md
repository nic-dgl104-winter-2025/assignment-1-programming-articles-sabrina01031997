# The Importance of Code Review Practices in Software Development

## Introduction

Code review is a crucial step in software development that ensures code quality, enforces best practices, and strengthens teamwork among developers. It is a systematic process where peers review written code to find bugs, enhance readability, and improve maintainability before merging it into a project.

For students in DGL 104, learning effective code review practices early on will significantly benefit their development skills and project outcomes. This article explores essential code review practices, their benefits, and how they contribute to better software quality.

## What is Code Review?

Code review is the process of examining code changes before integrating them into the main project. It ensures that the code is:
- **Bug-Free:** Detecting logical and functional errors early.
- **Maintainable:** Following best coding practices for future modifications.
- **Consistent:** Aligning with team or project coding standards.
- **Secure:** Preventing security risks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Efficient:** Improving code performance and reducing redundancy.

### Types of Code Reviews

1. **Pair Programming:** Two developers collaborate in real-time, writing and reviewing code simultaneously.
2. **Over-the-shoulder Reviews:** A developer explains their code to a peer, who provides immediate feedback.
3. **Tool-Assisted Reviews:** Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket facilitate structured reviews before merging.
4. **Formal Code Inspections:** A structured, documented review process, typically used in large-scale or critical projects.
